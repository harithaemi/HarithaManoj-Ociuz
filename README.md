## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **TypeScript** – type safety and better developer experience  
- **Vite** – fast development & build tool  
- **TailwindCSS / CSS** – styling

- **TypeScript Usage**: As a first-time TypeScript user, I defined types for `Service`, `Appointment`, and component props. Passing props between components was different from JSX, but it improved clarity and reduced errors.  

- **Challenges Faced**:  
  - Understanding and applying TypeScript’s strict type system.  
  - Learning how branches and pull requests actually work in Git.  
  - Ensuring dark mode worked consistently across components.
